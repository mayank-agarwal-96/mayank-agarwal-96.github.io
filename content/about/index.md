# About Me

I am a Software Engineer and a Computer Science graduate student at Virginia Tech. Before this, I worked at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) where I worked on various parts of the tech stack from frontend, backend and infrastructure for over 3 years. Some of my major contributions include rewriting the code-checker platform and adding support for intelligent auto-complete based on language server protocol. My complete work profile can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayank-agrawal-b680915a/). I can be reached via [email](mailto:"agarwalm214@gmail.com") as well.
