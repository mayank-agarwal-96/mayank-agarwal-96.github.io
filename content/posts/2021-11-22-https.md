I had been thinking to have my own website for a while now. Once I decided to stop the procrastination, it just took a couple of hours to get it up and running.

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go, to set up the site. I was looking for a simple design and the [cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) theme looked pretty good to me. I've also setup a simple github action to publish the website to github pages!

Hopefully I will use this site to post meaningful content in the future!
