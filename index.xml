Once I decided to stop the procrastination, it just took a couple of hours to get it up and running.
I used Hugo, a static site generator written in Go, to set up the site. I was looking for a simple design and the cactus theme looked pretty good to me. I&amp;rsquo;ve also setup a simple github action to publish the website to github pages!</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://mayankagrawal.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mayankagrawal.dev/about/</guid><description>About Me I am a Software Engineer and a Computer Science graduate student at Virginia Tech.
